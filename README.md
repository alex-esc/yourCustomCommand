# yourCustomCommand

Add custom commands in minecraft using /trigger with this datapack. Easy to modify and add your own commands, includes examples and explanations. The commands work in singleplayer and multiplayer, the commands even work for non-admins in servers.

Example: You could make a custom command that teleports you back to your base. So instead of typing the command '/tp @a 10 20 30' you can just type '/trigger goToBase'.

This is useful if you have multiple bases and you don't know the coordinates by heart to all your bases, or if a non-admin on a server wants to use teleportation commands to go to their base but you don't want to give them access to other admin-only commands like going into creative mode.

Custom commands can also execute a chain of commands one after the other. For example, if you find yourself using the same commands in the same order multiple times you can set up 1 command that does it for you.

More info is included on the datapack itself and the instructions text file. This is a fairly simple datapack, but for beginners this may seem confusing so on the documentation I try to break it down to the basics. A youtube tutorial is also available!
